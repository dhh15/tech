Extracting place names from corpus

We used 25 word concordances of our search terms as the corpus from which we investigated the place names. First Antti extracted all words beginning with a capital letter (and which occur only with capital letter) with their frequencies. We found around 3000 words from which Aino extracted proper place names by hand - list contained ocr-mistakes and common nouns. While doing that, very easily spottable ocr-mistakes were corrected (like 'MÃ¼nchen' written 'Miinchen'). Those around 500 words were parsed with Aino's script so that genetive and by hand corrected words merged - we got a list of place names with only small amount of duplicates - 422 words. It still contains some names which might not be place names. After correcting couple of - now clearly visible - ocr-mistakes, list was once again sorted and merged so that there was 404 names left.

Then Saara googled all the names which we didn't recognize (those with frequency higher than 3). Then we had 77 names. There were quite a many street names and couple of other names which we couldn't find unambigutious coordinates (like "Phoenix" which seemed to be usually a hotel in our contexts, but there were several hotels named Phoenix in Finland that time). We got coordinates for those 56 city and country names in  http://www.latlong.net/ and then visualized the places with their frequencies with visualizing tool Palladio http://palladio.designhumanities.org/
